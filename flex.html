                <p>

Clifford Webb, a passionate Chelsea supporter, came up with the name ‘The Shed’

                    For all the success clubs in London have enjoyed throughout the 150-year history of football in England, none can match Chelsea's achievement in lifting the Champions League trophy in 2012.
